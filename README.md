# sbtc-bridge

![ci](https://github.com/Trust-Machines/sbtc-bridge)


## Introduction

Sbtc-bridge supports a trustless two way peg between BTC and sBTC.
sBTC is a SIP-010 fungible token on the Stacks Blockchain that can be used in
defi protocols, nft marketplaces, governance and many more applications.

## Testnet

App has been tested with the Electrum wallet. On MacOs open Electrum wallet on testnet;

```bash
/Applications/Electrum.app/Contents/MacOS/run_electrum --testnet
```

To load the transaction;

1. Tools
2. Load Transaction
3. From text

Paste in the hex generated by the app. Check the tx fees. Sign and broadcast the tx.

### Wallet Support

The application is currently working with Electrum 4.3.3 and Bitcoin Core v22.

Support is planned for Ledger and Trezor.

#### Ledger Live

Ledger Live is the interface for Ledger hardware wallets

Note this is NOT Ledger Connect - Ledger Connect is  browser extension only supporting Safari and Ethereum/Polygon chains.

Test Mode

1. Download
2. Ledger on Bitcoin testnet
3. Enable developer mode

#### Trezor Suite

Trezor Suite is the interface for Trezor hardware wallets

Trezor hardware wallet can be paired with Electrum

Transaction signing error: -22: TX decode failed. Make sure the tx has at least one input.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm install sass
npm run dev
# or
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Deployment

First build the application;

```bash
npm run build
```

Note you can preview the production build locally with `npm run preview`.

#### Github Pages

Requires access to github settings and for a branch `gh-pages` to be created from `main`.
Then run;

```bash
node ./gh-pages.js
```

This pushes the contents of `build/` to the `gh-pages` branch. Github Pages
has been configured on the repository to serve the application from;

```bash
https://trust-machines.github.io/sbtc-bridge
```

The basic strategy is to deploy the `distribution files` to a branch called `gh-pages` and then configure Github Pages to serve the application from there. Details on Github Pages and Svelte
applications can be found in these guides.

- [Svelte + Github Pages how to](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-static#spa-mode)

#### Linode / Digital Ocean

Create your preferred target environment (Debian VM + Nginx for example).
Update the deploy script with your config and add your public ssh key to known hosts.
Then run;

```bash
bash ./deploy-remote.sh
```

### Packaging

The application can be packaged and uploaded to the npm registry;

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/svelte-kit package
cd package
npm publish
```


Scratch

I'm trying to create a custom script that has some arbitrary data followed by a multisig address paying to one of two public keys, where; pubkey1 is user defined (either ecdsa or schnorr derived) and pubkey2 is taproot (segwit v1).

The script is should end up something like;

```
pmnt = btc.p2tr_ms(1, [hex.decode(pubkey1), hex.decode(pubkey2)])
or
pmnt = btc.p2ms(1, [hex.decode(pubkey1), hex.decode(pubkey2)])
```

with the multi-sig wrapped in a custom script via a p2wsh address (or p2tr address?) e.g.

```
const wsh2 = {
    type: 'wsh',
    script: btc.Script.encode([<data>, 'DROP', pmnt.script])
}
const script = btc.p2wsh(wsh2, this.net);
```

My question is whether this is feasible and which combinations of pubkeys and multi sig payments are currently possible with scure btc signer ?
