![ci](https://github.com/Trust-Machines/sbtc-bridge)


## Introduction

Sbtc-bridge supports a trustless two way peg between BTC and sBTC.
sBTC is a SIP-010 fungible token on the Stacks Blockchain that can be used in
defi protocols, nft marketplaces, governance and many more applications.

## Testnet

App has been tested with the Electrum wallet. On MacOs open Electrum wallet on testnet;

```bash
/Applications/Electrum.app/Contents/MacOS/run_electrum --testnet
```

To load the transaction;

1. Tools
2. Load Transaction
3. From text

Paste in the hex generated by the app. Check the tx fees. Sign and broadcast the tx.

### Wallet Support

The application is currently working with Electrum 4.3.3 and Bitcoin Core v22.

Support is planned for Ledger and Trezor.

#### Ledger Live

Ledger Live is the interface for Ledger hardware wallets

Note this is NOT Ledger Connect - Ledger Connect is  browser extension only supporting Safari and Ethereum/Polygon chains.

Test Mode

1. Download
2. Ledger on Bitcoin testnet
3. Enable developer mode

#### Trezor Suite

Trezor Suite is the interface for Trezor hardware wallets

Trezor hardware wallet can be paired with Electrum

Transaction signing error: -22: TX decode failed. Make sure the tx has at least one input.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm install sass
npm run dev
# or
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Deployment

First build the application;

```bash
npm run build
```

Note you can preview the production build locally with `npm run preview`.

#### Github Pages

Requires access to github settings and for a branch `gh-pages` to be created from `main`.
Then run;

```bash
node ./gh-pages.js
```

This pushes the contents of `build/` to the `gh-pages` branch. Github Pages
has been configured on the repository to serve the application from;

```bash
https://trust-machines.github.io/sbtc-bridge
```

The basic strategy is to deploy the `distribution files` to a branch called `gh-pages` and then configure Github Pages to serve the application from there. Details on Github Pages and Svelte
applications can be found in these guides.

- [Svelte + Github Pages how to](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-static#spa-mode)

#### Linode / Digital Ocean

Create your preferred target environment (Debian VM + Nginx for example).
Update the deploy script with your config and add your public ssh key to known hosts.
Then run;

```bash
bash ./deploy-remote.sh
```

### Packaging

The application can be packaged and uploaded to the npm registry;

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/svelte-kit package
cd package
npm publish
```

## Production Deployment
`Dockerfile` is used to build the application and then serve.
Deployment 1 Current setup
- Merge PR to gcp branch.
- Then Google Cloud Build will trigger a build because it'w watching the gcp branch.
- Then Google Cloud Run will deploy the app which will serve the app on https://sbtc.world
- Has two builds one for mainnet and one for testnet.

Runtime network selection by Mike
- sbtc.world?net=mainnet&api=https://sbtc-api
- on the get request, we use mainnet to fetch a json object which has all other params
- config = configs[query_net]
- config['api'] = query_api
- VITE_STACKS_EXPLORER = config['VITE_STACKS_EXPLORER'] = config.VITE_STACKS_EXPLORER = config.vite_stacks_explorer
- deployment dimension: production and staging
- /v1 -> ?version=v1 -> if (config.version== v1) -> config else
- version dimension: v1 v2 
- net dimension: mainnet and testnet 
- api dimension:

Deployment 3 for Igor
- Run local build script to build pages and copy to GCP bucket.
- Pages will be served statically from GCP bucket.
- Has one build for any net.

Deployment 4 for Sergey
- Add to GitHub Actions (prod) and CloudFlare (devel): Run local build script to build pages and copy to GCP bucket.
- Pages will be served statically from GCP bucket
- Has one build for any net.

- Nirvana :)
